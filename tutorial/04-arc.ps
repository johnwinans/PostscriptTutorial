% drawing an arc


% draw a blue-green cross-hair at: 300,400
0 .8 .8 setrgbcolor
newpath
300 20 sub 400 moveto
40 0 rlineto			% 40 length line from x=280 to x=320 
300 400 20 sub moveto
0 40 rlineto
stroke



% draw a fat C at 300,400 with a radius of 100 and proceeds 
% clockwise from 45 to 315 degrees from the positive X axis.
0 setgray
100 setlinewidth
newpath
300 400 100 45 315 arc      % an arc includes its center point
stroke


% Draw the exact same arc but with a rounded linecap
1 setlinecap           % round 
0 setgray
100 setlinewidth

300 400 100 45 315 arc      % an arc includes its center point
stroke


% NOTE: This like setlinecap, setgray, setlinewidth are reset
% by a showpage.  But they are NOT reset by a stroke (or fill)

% arcn draws counter-clockwise...
% Note that this example uses the same values for all of the 
% arc parameters.  This will result in drawing the inverse 
% of what 'arc' did above.

0 setlinecap			% set linecap back to butt
.5 setgray				% medium gray
50 setlinewidth			% 1/2 as wide as the C above
300 400 100 45 315 arcn	% draw counter-clockwise

% drawing a circle is just an arc drawn all the way around
1 setlinewidth
1 setgray       % draw white
